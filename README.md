The motivation behind using AI applications, specifically the Movenet pose detection model, for detecting body stiffness in Parkinson’s disease and assisting with exercises is driven by several factors, Body stiffness is a common symptom of Parkinson’s disease, and its severity can vary among individuals. By using AI and pose detection models like Movenet, healthcare professionals can obtain objective measurements of a patient’s movements and joint angles. This allows for more accurate and consistent monitoring of body stiffness over time, enabling better assessment and management of the condition. Patients with Parkinson’s disease often struggle with executing exercises correctly due to motor impairments. AI applications using Movenet can provide real-time feedback during exercise sessions. By tracking the patient’s movements, the system can alert them to incorrect postures or movements, helping them make the necessary adjustments and ensuring they perform the exercises correctly.
Overall, the motivation behind AI applications for detecting body stiffness in Parkinson’s disease using Movenet pose detection model is to enhance the precision and effectiveness of exercises, enable personalized treatment, improve access to care, and provide valuable insights for better management of the condition.<img width="550" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 21 50 50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/040600a8-4b84-47e8-9e68-96c92fbbd942" />
